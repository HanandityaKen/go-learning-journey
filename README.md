# Go Learning Journey 🐹🚀

Hey there!  
This repo is my personal journey of learning the Go programming language.  
I’ve been coding in Go every single day — started 16 days ago, and still counting ✅

I’m keeping things simple: each folder is one day of practice, from the basics to more advanced stuff.  
It’s like my own little diary but in Go code 😎
